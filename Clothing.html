        Since the industrial revolution, many clothes are produced in factories.This can result in the exploitation of the workers and the pollution of
        the ecosystem. Many activists have tried to spread awareness because of the human consequences and this is one of many sites that tries to spread 
        awareness about the alternatives,specifically sustainable fashion. Sustainable fashion is a movement and process of fostering change to fashion 
        products and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. Sustainable fashion concerns more than just addressing 
        fashion textiles or products. It comprises addressing the whole system of fashion.

            <h1 class="h1">Why is Sustainable fashion important? </h1>
            <p>
                The word ‘Sustainability’ in the context of fashion most prominently refers to the environmental impacts of making 
                (raw material creation, processing and manufacture), wearing and caring for (use) and the disposal of clothing (end of use).
                We take resources and use water and chemicals along the way, to create a garment. You buy and wear the garment and then throw it away (or donate it)
                when you’re done…. But then what happens? Generally it goes to landfill or is incinerated.
                Today, only 20% of all clothing is recycled. In order for the fashion industry to really become more sustainable, brands need to work towards 
                developing circular systems whereby garments become fully recyclable after use, reducing the need to create virgin fibres.And while big industry 
                players are pursuing this, it will take time. In the meantime, addressing our individual consumption rates, by reducing the volume of clothing we 
                buy, as well as dispose of, can help.

    <h2><bold>Bamboo</bold></h2>
Bamboo is a fast-growing, regenerative crop that doesn’t require fertilization and is often touted as a sustainable garment fabric—though there are concerns about land clearing and harvesting methods (something to ask a brand about before purchasing a garment). That said, bamboo is incredibly absorbent, comfortable, and moisture-wicking, making it a favorite with sustainable brands.  

<h2><bold>Hemp</bold></h2>
Hemp is a specific type of cannabis plant. It’s fast-growing, doesn’t exhaust the soil, and doesn’t require pesticides. Hemp creates a durable fabric that’s non-irritating for skin and has many uses. It’s often used in place of cotton. This fabric is often more expensive, making it less accessible to everyone. True hemp doesn’t require a certification and is already organic, but you can verify with a brand that their garments are 100 percent hemp (not just made with hemp fibers) before purchasing. 

<h2><bold>Linen</bold></h2>
Linen is made from flax, which can be grown without fertilizer and planted in areas where other crops cannot thrive. Flax can also be used in its entirety (seeds, oil, and crop), meaning there’s no waste. Linen is also biodegradable—as long as harsh chemicals are left out of the process. The downside to linen is that it can be expensive as it’s often made overseas. For more affordable, USA-made 100% linen, check out Linoto.

<h2><bold>Modal</bold></h2>
Modal is another semi-synthetic material made from wood pulp but mainly that of beech trees. The naturally occurring yet human-made fabric is generally more delicate and softer than its lyocell sibling
